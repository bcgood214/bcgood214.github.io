				<p>Ace Supply, Inc. is an Alaskan owned and operated petroleum equipment sales company. Ace was established in 1962 by a very ambitious young woman who began selling equipment
				to enhance the expanding ACE FUEL delivery company and Standard Service Station that she was already operating. The boom of the Alaska pipeline spurred the shift from ACE FUEL into
				the next level of equipment sales and supply for the Great Land. In the mid 80â€™s Ace endured the crash of the pipeline and began to expand into alternate industries by
				supplying all levels of refined petroleum handling equipment. Today Ace Supply, Inc. is on its third generation of ownership and continues the long-held commitment to the transfer
				and filtration of petroleum products for the Great Land, Alaska.

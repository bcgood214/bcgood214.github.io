				<p style="font-family:open sans;font-size:20pt;line-height:200%;">Ace Supply, Inc. is an Alaskan owned and operated petroleum equipment sales company. Ace was established in 1962 by a very ambitious young woman who began selling equipment to
				enhance the expanding ACE FUEL delivery company and Standard Service Station that she was already operating. The boom of the Alaska pipeline spurred the shift from ACE FUEL into the next
				level of equipment sales and supply for the Great Land. In the mid 80â€™s Ace endured the crash of the pipeline and began to expand into alternate industries by supplying all levels of 
				refined petroleum handling equipment. Today Ace Supply, Inc. is on its third generation of ownership and continues the long-held commitment to the transfer and filtration of petroleum 
				products for the Great Land, Alaska.</p>
